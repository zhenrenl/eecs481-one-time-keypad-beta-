Welcome to One-Time Keypad (OTK)

This is a quick tutorial on how to use the Alpha release of OTK and its included features:

1. How to Run OTK
a. Start by ensuring you have python 3.5 installed and added to your path variables
b. Next run start.py in command line located in /path/to/OTK/start.py
c. This should start the process. Now type the keys on the keypad and see them appear in your application of choice.

2. Included features
a. The keyboard is intended to have multiple 'mappings' such that each mapping allows you to type a separate set of characters on every mapping. 
b. There is a virtual keyboard on the screen that shows the user what character appears on the application when they click on the corresponding position of the num pad.
b. The tab button on top of the keypad acts as a switch button which changes the set of characters that the user can click on.
c. An auto-complete feature is implemented for the user to type sentences faster based on word usage statistics.
d. When a key is pressed on the keypad, the on-screen user interface flashes the corresponding key to let the user know the key they pressed.
